<Notes>

At Red Queen, we're constantly searching for innovative ways to work with game data and APIs.

In this pursuit, I recently discovered some software I think is cool, called "GraphQL-Yoga",

and I want to share it with you and talk about why I like it.

# Architecture

1. Type Definitions
2. Resolvers

---

export default Split;

# Sample Type Definitions

```js
const typeDefs = `
  type Query {
    hello(name: String): String!
  }
`
```

---

export default Split;

# Sample Resolvers

```js
const resolvers = {
  Query: {
    hello: (_, { name }) => `Hello ${name || 'World'}`,
  },
}
```

<h1>Sure, Dan.</h1>

  <h1>But why's it cool?</h1>
</Appear>

<Notes>

I'm frequently rolling out new APIs to support gameplay toolmakers or to power various projects.

Yoga makes it fast and easy to create these APIs with a powerful GraphQL interface and a helpful Playground.

# I'll give you an example:

<div>
    <p style={{"textAlign": "left"}}>Provided a Zipcode, return USPS data, weather, and congressional reps.</p>
</div>

<div>
    <ul style={{"display": "block", "textAlign": "left"}}>
        <li>Input: zipcode</li>
        <li>Output: JSON</li>
        <li>
          <label>Function: Query 3 APIs</label>
          <ul>
              <li>USPS</li>
              <li>Weather</li>
              <li>Federal Representatives</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
</div>
<Notes>

Suppose you want an app that gave users information about a Zipcode.

* the USPS data
* the current weather
* info about their elected representatives.

We'd need to pull data from 3 seprate APIs, but we can get all of this information with just 1 Yoga call.
</Notes>

export default Split;

# Simplest User Input

```graphql
query{
  lookup(zipcode: "08901"){
    usps
    weather,
    reps
  }
}

```

<Notes>

1. We're going to call a query called "lookup"
2. We're going to pass in a value called "zipcode"
3. We'd like our response to include three fields: `usps`, `weather` and `reps`

When building an API, I like to think about the code my intended users they might try to write.

The simplest graphql query to supply a zipcode, and lookup usps, weather and representatives data.
</Notes>

---
# Type Definitions

export default Split;

```graphql
scalar ZipCodeResult
scalar WeatherResult
scalar RepresentativesResult

type ResultSet {
    usps: ZipCodeResult,
    weather: WeatherResult
    reps: [RepresentativesResult]
}

type Query {
    lookup(zipcode: String): ResultSet
}
```

<Notes>

1. We define 3 scalar types, one for each data results.
2. We then declare a single ResultSet object, to collect our response
3. We define our `Query` type, and our single `lookup` query with a `zipcode` `String` parameter that returns our defined `ResultSet`.

I'll point out, this is super lazy. Really, I should define specific types for each of the three Results. But I want to point out that this will get you up and running with all of your data, even before you know what it looks like.

2. JavaScript Resolver Functions
3. GraphQL Type Definitions
4. Client API

So now that you've seen the remote API calls, 
the schema to describe our makeshift API, 
and the simple query our user wants to send us
Here's our index.js

```notes
So, I first discovered GraphQL-Yoga in early autumn from the [HowToGraphQL.com](https://www.howtographql.com/graphql-js/0-introduction/) website. It's still listed in their tutorial. However, I started using Yoga, an alternate NodeJS GraphQL server has been released called Apollo Server 2. Yoga was built to address issues present in Apollo Server 1. However, with the latest release, it's widely accepted that much of Yoga's initial benefits have been lost. I considered changing my talk topic to discuss Apollo Server 2. However, Apollo Server 2 supports a nearly identical API to GraphQL-Yoga, so just shy of 100% of this presentation is useful verbatim for Apollo Server 2.
```

<h1>Pros</h1>
<div style={{"width": "100%", "textAlign": "left", "margin": "auto"}}>+ Effortlessly wrap and extend existing APIs</div>
<Appear>
<div style={{"width": "100%", "textAlign": "left", "margin": "auto"}}>+ Easily consolidate or aggregate APIs to build data pipelines</div>
<div style={{"width": "100%", "textAlign": "left", "margin": "auto"}}>+ Quickly mock and build new APIs</div>
<h1>Cons</h1>
<div style={{"width": "100%", "textAlign": "left", "margin": "auto"}}>- Being replaced with Apollo Server 2</div>
</Appear>
